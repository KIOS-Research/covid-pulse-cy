## Description

Systematically monitoring of urban wastewater in Cyprus for the presence of selected RNA genetic markers of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its variants, 
to better understand the dynamics and spatiotemporal trends of the COVID-19 pandemic.

There is a large team of scientists with diverse scientific backgrounds and expertise working for PULSE. The team 
comprises: 

- The [Nireas-International Water Research Center (Nireas-IWRC)](https://nireas-iwrc.org/) of the [University of 
  Cyprus](https://www.ucy.ac.cy/) who is responsible for 
  the 
determination of the SARS-CoV-2 genetic fragments and the epidemiological analysis of SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in urban wastewater.

- The [KIOS Research and Innovation Centre of Excellence (KIOS CoE)](https://www.kios.ucy.ac.cy/) of the [University of Cyprus](https://www.ucy.ac.cy/) who is responsible 
  for 
the development of the SARS-CoV-2 monitoring platform.

- The [Molecular Virology Department of the Cyprus Institute of Neurology and Genetics (CING)](https://www.cing.ac.cy/en/about-us/biomedical-sciences-/mv) who is responsible for 
the identification of the most prevalent SARS-CoV-2 variants in urban wastewater. 

In the framework of Commission Recommendation (EU) 2021/472, the European Commission financed the [Water Development 
Department (WDD)](http://www.moa.gov.cy/moa/wdd/Wdd.nsf/index_en/index_en?OpenDocument) as the Coordinating Authority for wastewater to coordinate the establishment of a systematic 
surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants in the wastewater of Cyprus.  

The project is financed by the [Water Development Department (WDD)](http://www.moa.gov.cy/moa/wdd/Wdd.nsf/index_en/index_en?OpenDocument) of the [Ministry of Agriculture](https://moa.gov.cy/ministry/mission/?lang=en), [Rural Development 
and Environment](https://moa.gov.cy/sectors/rural-development/rural-development-and-environment/?lang=en) and the 
Medical and Public Health Services (MPHS) of the [Ministry of Health of the Republic of 
Cyprus](https://www.moh.gov.cy/moh/moh.nsf/medpub_en/medpub_en?OpenDocument).
