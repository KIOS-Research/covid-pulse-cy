# PULSE: Pancyprian sUrveilLance of SARS-CoV-2 in urban wastEwater

Systematically monitoring of urban wastewater in Cyprus for the presence of selected RNA genetic markers of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its variants, 
to better understand the dynamics and spatiotemporal trends of the COVID-19 pandemic.   ![logopulse](https://github.com/KIOS-Research/covid-pulse-cy/assets/49236697/d7dafc3f-0e8d-4a30-8f73-d05c2db378ea)

There is a large team of scientists with diverse scientific backgrounds and expertise working for PULSE. The team comprises: 

The Nireas-International Water Research Center (Nireas-IWRC) of the University of Cyprus for the determination of the SARS-CoV-2 genetic fragments in urban wastewater, who is also leading the project  

The KIOS Research and Innovation Centre of Excellence (KIOS CoE) of the University of Cyprus for the development of the SARS-CoV-2 monitoring platform 

The Medical School of the University of Cyprus for the epidemiological analysis of SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in urban wastewater 

The Molecular Virology Department of the Cyprus Institute of Neurology and Genetics (CING) for the identification of the most prevalent SARS-CoV-2 variants in urban wastewater. 

The project is financed by the Water Development Department (WDD) of the Ministry of Agriculture, Rural Development and Environment and the Medical and Public Health Services (MPHS) of the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Cyprus.  

In the framework of Commission Recommendation (EU) 2021/472, the European Commission financed the WDD to coordinate the establishment of a systematic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants in the wastewater of Cyprus.
